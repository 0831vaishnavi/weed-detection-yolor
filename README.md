## 1. Weed Detection Using YOLOR

### Description
This project aims to develop a real-time weed detection system for agricultural applications. Using YOLOR (You Only Learn One Representation), the model is trained on custom datasets to accurately distinguish weeds from crops, helping farmers optimize weed control measures. The system leverages the power of deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve high precision and efficiency.

### Workflow
1. **Data Collection and Annotation**  
   - Captured agricultural field images containing weeds and crops.  
   - Annotated the images using Roboflow for dataset preparation.

2. **Model Training**  
   - Trained the YOLOR model using TensorFlow and Python on the annotated dataset.  
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize detection accuracy.

3. **Real-Time Detection**  
   - Integrated OpenCV for image and video processing.  
   - Deployed the model for real-time weed detection in live agricultural settings.

### Steps
1. Gather and annotate images of crops and weeds.
2. Preprocess the dataset and split it into training and testing sets.
3. Train the YOLOR model on the dataset.
4. Validate the model for accuracy and performance.
5. Deploy the system for real-time weed detection using OpenCV.

### Outcome
The project successfully classified weeds and crops in real time, achieving high accuracy and improving weed management efficiency for agricultural applications.
